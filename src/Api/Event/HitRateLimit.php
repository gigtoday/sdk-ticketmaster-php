/**
 *
 * HitRateLimit
 *
 * This event is fired if the client has made too many api calls in a given
 * time period.
 *
 * The best way to deal with rate limiting is to process the api requests
 * in a queuing system. You can then defer jobs that access the API, upon the
 * first 429 response, until after the rate has been reset. This approach has
 * the advantage of using the API as fast as is possible, then pausing.
 *
 * A less desirable solution is to pause/sleep any processes that use the API
 * after each call; this doesnâ€™t respond as well to changes in the limits, nor
 * to two processes using the API at once.
